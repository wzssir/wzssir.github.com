				<p class="tools_step2_textList"><i>Promulgating Institution:</i>Supreme Peoples Court</p>
				<p class="tools_step2_textList"><i>Document Number:</i>Legal Issue [2009] No.23</p>

				<p>China's economy, at present, maintains a steady and progressive growth trend, reformation and globalization are assuming predominance, social undertakings are undergoing rapid development and there is a marked improvement in people's livelihood. However, the Chinese economy is also faced with severe difficulties and challenges. For the purposes of effectively implementing the spirit of the annual session of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, enforcing the national strategy on intellectual property rights (IPR), making the trial of IPR-related cases serve the efforts to counter the negative impact of the global financial crisis and promote the steady and progressive development of the national economy, the following opinions are issued concerning the trial of IPR related cases by the people's courts at all levels:</p>
				<p><em>1.</em> Ensure that the trial of IPR cases serves the overall national interests of China more effectively after considering the actual conditions prevalent in China and according high priorities to major tasks.</p>
				<p>(1) Fully appreciate the significance of IPR protection in promoting steady and rapid economic development, and consciously inculcate a sense of duty to serve the overall national interests. IPR, which is the primary indicator of a country's capacity and strength of scientific and technological innovation, is a strategic resource for the development of a country and a key factor in elevating the international competitiveness of the country. Modern economic competition is, in the final analysis, a competition of intellectual property rights. Therefore, enhancing IPR protection and improving the creation, application and management of IPR are significant for accelerating economic restructuring, transforming the mode of development, advancing independent innovation, deepening reform and enhancing the level of opening up to the outside world and ultimately promoting steady economic development. According to historical records, an economic crisis is often accompanied by technological revolution, which in turn serves as an important drive for a new round of economic growth and prosperity. In the current economic context, enhancing IPR protection plays a vital role in effectively advancing technological innovation and technological revolution, generating new and emerging industries, creating new market demand, cultivating new points of economic growth and steering economic development toward new directions.</p>
				<p>(2) Closely follow the new requirements for the trial of IPR cases by the changes in both international and domestic economic situations to the IPR trial and effectively drive the trial of such cases towards serving the overall national interests in a more precise, effective and active manner. The current economic environment places new and higher requirements and expectations on the trial of IPR cases. Therefore, judicial protection of IPR shall be further strengthened. With a view to maximizing the benefits accruing out of the trial of IPR cases in countering the challenges brought about by global financial crisis and turning the crisis into economic opportunities, courts at all levels shall enhance their sensitivity towards crisis situations, prepare themselves for the unexpected, increase their awareness of the macro environment and consciousness of the overall national situation. Greater attention shall be paid to expanding room for innovation, towards promoting the cultivation of self-owned IPR and brands of China, and new economic growth points, to enhancing the market competitiveness of the Chinese enterprises and the core competitiveness of China. Greater emphasis should be placed on the cultivation of an open and free trade and investment environment, so as to regulate market order, safeguard fair competition, improve the socialist market economy system of China and facilitate the construction of a credibility-oriented society.</p>
				<p><em>2.</em> Strengthen the protection of IPR, enhance the capacity of scientific and technological innovation, expand space for innovation and actively promote independent innovation.</p>
				<p>(3) With focus on the implementation of the newly-revised <strong>Patent Law</strong> of China, attach importance to and improve the trial of patent cases. Achievements of scientific and technological innovations, especially patents, reflect the core competitiveness of an enterprise and a country. Therefore, enhancing IPR protection is the most direct and important measure for promoting scientific and technological progress and independent innovation. All courts concerned shall, with a strong sense of responsibility and mission to improve China's capacity of innovation and transform China into an innovation-oriented country, attach great importance to the trial of patent cases and give priority to improving the trial of patent cases. In doing so, the courts shall fully appreciate the legislative spirit and purpose of the <strong>Patent Law</strong>, enhance investigation and research, so as to uncover and solve newly arisen issues in a timely manner and ensure that the newly-revised <strong>Patent Law</strong> shall be correctly and effectively implemented and applied.</p>
				<p>(4) Master judicial policies on patent and effectively enhance the protection of patent rights. Reasonable scope and strength of judicial protection of patent shall be defined in light of the actual conditions of China and the development stage of science and technology of China, and in accordance with relevant laws and industry IPR policies. As a result, on the one hand, enterprises shall be motivated to invest in innovation, individuals are encouraged to engage in innovation and the society as a whole should be dynamic with infused enthusiasm for innovation; on the other hand, patent rights shall not be used to impede technological progress or to hinder competitors. The capital and technological resources of the entire society will be fully utilized and allocated and the transmission and utilization of technological data will be accelerated. The principles and methods for determining patent infringement shall be correctly applied, trial experiences shall be further summarized and the rules on claim interpretation and the standards for the determination of infringement by comparison shall be improved. The claims for invention and utility model shall be correctly interpreted and the scope of patent protection shall be correctly defined. The protection scope of patent right shall not be interpreted strictly in light of the literal meaning of the claim, nor shall the claim be used as a technological direction that may be adjusted at will. Rather, a proper balance shall be stricken between the aforementioned two extremes so that the interpretation of patent claims is capable of providing fair protection to the patent holder on the one hand and is able to provide the public with reasonable legal stability. All technical features included in an independent claim shall be covered by the comparison of technical features. A claimant of patent right shall be prohibited from retracting any substantial waiver or limitation that it makes during the confirmation process of the patent right and relevant technical contents of such waiver or limitation shall not be included in the protection scope of the patent right. The application conditions of infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents shall be rigorous and the rules on the application of infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents shall be improved so as to prevent any improper extension of the protection scope. All non-infringement defenses or infringement shall be subject to careful examination so as to properly determine the prior use right and support existing technical defense in accordance with the laws.</p>
				<p><em>3.</em> Enhance the protection of business logos, actively promote the development of brand economy, regulate market order and safeguard the principles of fair competition.</p>
				<p>(5) The market value of well-known brands shall be fully appreciated and the protection of such brands shall be enhanced. As the embodiment of the competitive advantage of an enterprise, a well-known brand serves as a powerful weapon for the enterprise in competing in the international market and represents core economic competitiveness. Therefore, brands are strategic assets of both the enterprises and the State and are the major factor that determines the trend of the market consumption. People's courts shall enhance the protection of trademark right and prevent unfair competition, so as to provide a harmonious and favorable legal environment for the cultivation and development of well-known brands, promote the development of brand economy, stimulate existing consumer demand and create new consumer demand, fuel economic growth and improve the domestic and international competitiveness of Chinese enterprises.</p>
				<p>(6) Improve judicial policies on trademark, enhance the protection of trademark rights and promote the cultivation of self-owned brands. Correctly appreciate the nature of trademark right as an exclusive right, and properly define the scope of trademark right so as to ensure that trademark resources are properly utilized on the one hand and fair competition is safeguarded on the other. In addition, protection of the core exclusive right of trademark shall be enhanced on the basis of certified commodities and duly certified and approved trademarks, and the sphere of exclusion of trademark right shall be properly defined in light of market confusion, so as to set clear and definite separation lines for the use of trademark and to provide sufficient legal space for the creation and development of self-owned brands. Where in the absence of due authorization by the registrant of a trademark, another party uses the trademark for the same kind of commodities as that for which the trademark is registered, such infringement may be determined without considering the factor of confusion, except where such use is deemed reasonable. The determination of similarity between commodities or trademarks shall be conducted in light of distinctiveness and publicity of the trademark for which protection is applied for. The greater the distinctiveness and publicity of a registered trademark, the protection scope shall be wider and the intensity of the protection be stronger, so as to encourage fair winners of market competition, improve market environment and prevent the incurring of undue advantages or imitation with respect to trademarks.</p>
				<p>(7) Properly handle the relationship between actually using a registered trademark and bearing corresponding civil liabilities so that the assumption of civil liabilities will be conducive to encouraging the use of trademarks, revitalizing trademark resources and preventing illicit speculation by taking advantage of registered trademarks. Where a registered trademark for which protection is applied for has not been put into commercial use, an order for cessation of infringement may be adopted as a major remedy in determining civil liabilities; in determining the liability for compensation, the court, as a general rule, shall take into account the fact that the trademark concerned has not been put into commercial use and shall not determine the amount of compensation in light of the profit by the alleged infringing party, if there is no other loss or damage incurred in addition to the reasonable costs of safeguarding the trademark right. Where the registrant or transferee of a trademark has no intention of actually using such trademark, but employs it solely as a tool of obtaining compensation, the court may rule that no compensation be made to the registrant or transferee; where a trademark has been out of use for three consecutive years, as provided in the <strong>Trademark Law</strong>, the court may reject the claim for compensation by the owner of such trademark.</p>
				<p>(8) Review and supervision of the judicial recognition of well-known trademarks shall be enhanced and the judicial system for the protection of well-known trademarks shall be approved so as to safeguard the authority and credibility of judicial protection. The scope and criteria for the recognition of well-known trademarks shall be strictly adhered to, and any extension of such scope or relaxation of such criteria shall be strictly forbidden. Where the recognition of well-known trademarks is not necessary for the determination of infringement, such recognition shall not be carried out. Where a registered trademark may be protected through the determination of similar commodities, it is not necessary to determine whether the trademark is a well-known trademark or not. With respect to a legally qualified well-known trademark, the protection shall be enhanced and infringements upon such trademark, including degradation or dilution of such trademark, shall be strictly forbidden so as to protect the brand value of well-known trademarks in accordance with law. The Notice of the Supreme People's Court on Issues concerning the Jurisdiction of Civil Cases Involving the Determination of Well-known Trademarks (Legal Issue [2009] No. 1) shall be strictly implemented. Cases that are accepted by a court without competent jurisdiction after the issuance of said Notice shall be referred to a court with competent jurisdiction; cases that have been accepted but not closed at the issuance of said Notice shall be strictly subject to the pre-trial review system. Courts at all levels shall enhance the review and adjudication supervision over cases for which well-known trademark recognition has been carried out, and shall rectify, through the adjudication supervision procedures, cases involving trademark(s) whose status as well-known trademark(s) is secured through false evidence or other illegal means. Where a party to a case involving recognition of well-known trademarks is liable for obstruction of civil proceedings, such party shall be subject to sanctions in accordance with law. A court with competent jurisdiction shall accept supervision from relevant parties over judicial recognition of well-known trademarks and solve the problems that are uncovered in a timely manner. After the promulgation of judicial interpretations concerning the judicial protection of well-known trademarks, courts at all levels shall effectively implement such interpretations to further regulate the judicial protection of well-known trademarks.</p>
				<p>(9) Improve the trial of cases involving the determination of trademark authorization and properly handle the relationship between protecting trademark rights and maintaining market order. On the one hand, improper and hasty registration of a prior trademark by others shall be effectively contained and the protection for prior trademarks with certain publicity shall be enhanced; on the other hand, the nature of trademark right as a relative right shall be correctly appreciated and due prudence shall be exercised in granting cross-category protection to registered trademarks which are not certified as well-known trademarks. The public-right-based grounds and the private-right-based grounds for cancelling trademark registration shall be correctly differentiated to prevent improper expansion of scope of cancelling trademark registration and avoid arbitrary cancellation of trademark registration. The registration of a trademark that has been registered and used for a relatively long period of time, has garnered good market reputation and has been accepted by the related public shall not be cancelled without due prudence. Furthermore, in addition to protecting priority right in accordance with the law, the court shall take into account the prevalent situation in the market that the relevant public has differentiated the trademarks concerned from each other. The legislative spirit of the <strong>Trademark Law</strong> to coordinate the protection of priority right and maintaining market order shall be correctly appreciated and due attention shall be paid to maintaining an established and stable market order, so as to prevent parties concerned from engaging in illicit speculation by exploiting the trademark dispute system and to avoid the potential major difficulties that arbitrary cancellation of a registered trademark may cause to the operation of enterprises. Where a registered trademark in conflict with the copyright and the enterprise name right of others cannot be cancelled due to the expiration of time limits for dispute as provided in the <strong>Trademark Law</strong>, the priority right holder may still file an infringement lawsuit within the time prescribed by the statute of limitations. The people's court, however, shall not order the party concerned to incur the civil liability of terminating the use of the said registered trademark.</p> 
				<p>(10) The conflicts among a registered trademark, name of enterprise and priority right shall be properly handled so as to prevent practices of unfair competition such as "misleading imitation of well-known brands". In addition to civil disputes over conflict of rights between registered trademarks, civil disputes over conflicts of rights among registered trademark, enterprise name and priority right , including disputes in which the defendant alters the registered trademark in actual use or exceeds the scope for which the use of trademark is authorized, shall also be accepted by the people's courts, as long as such disputes qualify as civil disputes and meet the acceptance requirements provided in the <strong>Civil Procedure Law</strong>. The fact that an alleged infringing trademark has not been registered at the time of acceptance of the infringement case shall not prevent a competent people's court from accepting and hearing the infringement case; where an alleged infringing trademark has been registered, but is a duplication, imitation or translation of a prior well-known trademark, a competent people' court shall accept and hear the infringement case.</p> 
				<p>Such trademark conflict cases shall be heard in accordance with the principles of upholding good faith, safeguarding fair competition and protecting priority right. Where a trademark which has been duly registered with industry and commerce authorities constitutes trademark infringement or unfair competition in essence, the court shall rule that such trademark constitutes trademark infringement or unfair competition. Such ruling shall not be subject to the prerequisites of administrative sanction, nor shall legal proceedings be suspended due to such administrative sanction. With respect to business logos such as enterprise names which are obtained outside the territory of China in accordance with relevant overseas laws and regulations, if the use of such business logos in China is in violation of Chinese laws and disturbs the market economic order of China, such use shall, on the basis of the principles that intellectual property rights are both independent and geographic specific, be ruled to constitute trademark infringement or unfair competition in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations. Where the conspicuous use of an enterprise name infringes on the exclusive right to a prior registered trademark, such use shall be deemed as an infringement on trademark; where the enterprise name is not used in a conspicuous manner but the use is sufficient to cause market confusion and breach of fair competition, such practice shall be deemed as unfair competition. With respect to a conflict of rights between a registered trademark and an enterprise name that arises due to historical reasons instead of the parties' malicious intentions, the court shall resolve such conflict in a fair and just manner on the basis of the specific circumstances of the conflict, with due consideration given to such historical reasons and the current state of the trademark. The court shall refrain from determining in a simplistic manner that the aforementioned conflict of rights constitutes trademark infringement or unfair competition. In hearing cases involving disputes over business logos such as time-honored brand names whose ownership has been clearly settled, the court shall pay due respect to the historical tradition and safeguard the legal order that has been established. The business name in an enterprise name or the abbreviation of an enterprise name that enjoys reasonable market recognition, is familiar to the relevant public and has taken on the effect of de facto trade name of the enterprise shall be deemed as an enterprise name and be protected against unfair competition. Where the use of an enterprise name causes trademark infringement, the court may, in light of the actual circumstances of the case, either order the cessation of the use of the name, or set limits on the mode and scope in which such name may be used. Where a registered and popular trademark of one party is improperly used by another party for its enterprise name, which is likely to cause market confusion regardless of whether such name is used in a conspicuous manner or not, the court shall rule that such enterprise name be ceased for use or changed on the basis of the parties' requests. Where the party concerned refuse to implement the judgment of ceasing the use of such enterprise name, the court shall strengthen the enforcement of judgment and corresponding compensation and remedy measures.</p>
				<p>(11) Enhance the trial of cases involving unfair competition and monopoly and properly coordinate the relationship between free and fair competition, so as to promote the optimization of the market structure and the improvement of the socialist market economy of China. The relationship between special intellectual property right laws, including laws on patent, trademark and copyright, and the anti-unfair competition law shall be properly handled. The supplementary protection by the anti-unfair competition law shall not be in conflict with the legislative policies of special laws. Where special laws have been exhaustive on a certain issue, extended protection, as a general rule, shall not be provided in accordance with the anti-unfair competition law. Where exhaustive protection is prescribed in the special provisions of the anti-unfair competition law for a certain practice, the protection scope for such act shall not be extended in accordance with general provisions; where there is no special provision for a certain competition practice, such practice may be deemed as unfair competition practice only when it is determined in accordance with established business standards and universally accepted knowledge to be against general provisions, so as to prevent the improper extension of the scope of unfair competition that may hinder free and fair competition. The relationship between the protection of trade secrets and freedom of employment, and that between the non-competition requirements on people in possession of trade secrets and the reasonable flow of talents shall be properly handled so as to safeguard the employees' legitimate rights of employment and commencement of business. Great importance shall be attached to implementing the anti-monopoly law by effectively adjudicating all types of cases involving disputes over monopoly, containing practices of monopoly and safeguarding fair trade so as to provide a flexible and favorable environment for the establishment and development of enterprises.</p>
				<p><em>4.</em> Improve the intellectual property right litigation system and the trade and investment environment and actively promote the opening-up of markets to the outside world.</p> 
				<p>(12) Enhance the protection of litigation rights and ensure the accessibility of litigation channels. Protection of litigation rights shall be enhanced in accordance with law. Lawsuits brought before a court that meet the requirements for acceptance shall be handled in a timely manner. A lawyer who is expressly authorized by a claimant to bring a lawsuit before a court on behalf of the claimant shall have the right to act in the name of the claimant and as is necessary for an overseas party to safeguard its rights, such party shall not be obliged to sign and seal the complaint. In view of the actual trial practices of intellectual property right cases, all litigation systems shall be improved, remedy procedures shall be simplified and measures for the convenience and benefits of the masses shall be adopted to raise the efficiency of judicial remedy.</p> 
				<p>(13) The litigation system for determination of non-infringement shall be improved to restrain the abuse of intellectual property rights and thereby provide a safe and favorable environment for trade and investment. Continued efforts shall be made to explore and improve the litigation system for determination of non-infringement in the field of intellectual property rights so as to fully exert the function of such system in protecting investments and business operations.<br/> 
				Where the owner of an intellectual property right issues an infringement warning to specific entities and fails to bring a lawsuit over such infringement to a court within a reasonable period of time, the party that has been issued with such warning may initiate litigation proceedings for determination of non-infringement.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, where an entity who engages in or intends to engage in business operations such as establishing a new factory receives an infringement warning or intimidation made by the owner of intellectual property right through other means, other than the one mentioned in the preceding sentence and such entity requests, on its own initiative, the owner to make a confirmation of voluntary non-infringement by providing all necessary materials and data to such owner to request the owner of the intellectual property right to confirm that the operations of such party do not constitute infringement, and however, if the owner, fails to reply within a reasonable period of time or refuses to confirm, then in this case, the owner of the said entity may also initiate a lawsuit for the confirmation of non-infringement. In hearing cases of confirmation determination of non-infringement concerning trade secrets, the court shall ensure the legitimate rights and interests of the plaintiff and the security of the investment of the plaintiff on the one hand, and shall prevent the plaintiff from obtaining the trade secrets of other parties through abuse of the process of litigation.</p>
				<p>(14) The court shall strictly observe the legal requirements and shall use with due prudence the measures of pre-trial cessation of infringement. Adoption of the measures of pre-trial cessation of infringement shall be subject to the principle of "active prudence and reasonable effectiveness" so as to ensure that the relationship between preventing infringement and safeguarding normal business operation is properly handled. Pre-trial cessation of infringement applies primarily to cases where matters of fact are clear and the infringement is readily identifiable. In this case, appropriate and strict application of the standards for the determination of infringement possibility shall be followed so that the determination of infringement shall be essentially beyond reasonable doubt. In determining whether the infringement may cause irreparable damages to the applicant, the court shall focus on whether the damages are available and the reasonable expectations for the enforcement of the remedy. The amount of security deposit shall be determined primarily in light of the losses that may be caused to the party against which the application is made as well as the amount of claim made by the applicant, so that such amount shall be reasonable and effective. The public interests' defense by the party against which the application is made shall be strictly examined and may only be accepted when public health, environmental protection and other major social interests are involved. Pre-trial cessation of infringement involves major economic interests and market prospects of the parties. Therefore, the court shall pay due attention to preventing and regulating the abuse of relevant rights by the parties concerned. The business status of the enterprises concerned shall be given due consideration by the court so as to prevent the business of such enterprises from falling into difficulties due to improper measures adopted by the court. Especially in the trial of cases involving patent infringement, where the practice of the party against which the application is made does not constitute literal infringement, and therefore such practice may be determined only after further trial and complicated technical comparison is conducted, the court is advised not to order pre-trial cessation of patent infringement; where the party against which the application is made has initiated a separate lawsuit for confirmation of non-infringement or has submitted a request for the invalidation of the patent right involved in the case in accordance with law, the court shall conduct examination of the facts and ground claimed by the party against which the application is made and shall exert due prudence in adopting relevant measures. On the basis of the progress of the case, the court shall revoke the verdict of pre-trial cessation of infringement at an appropriate time in accordance with law. The remedy for the party harmed by pre-trial infringement cessation measures improperly applied shall be enhanced. Where the applicant fails to bring the lawsuit before the court within the legal time limit or improper application has been essentially constituted and the injured party initiates litigation for compensation, the court shall order sufficient due compensation for the injured party. Where one party, for the purpose of undermining major business operations by another party, such as hindering another party from launching new products in the market, maliciously applies for measures for pre-trial cessation of infringement and thereby causes grave damage to the market interests of another party, the court shall pay due attention towards ensuring that the victimized party shall be granted sufficient protection.</p>
				<p>(15) The remedy function of cessation of infringement shall be fully exerted and the liability of cessation of infringement shall be properly applied so as to effectively restrain infringement practices. On the basis of the party's claims, the specific conditions of the case and the actual requirements for cessation of infringement, the court may expressly order the parties concerned to destroy the specialized materials and equipments used to produce infringing products, subject to the prerequisite that such destruction measures shall be absolutely necessary, in consonance with the gravity of an infringement and shall not result in unnecessary damages. Where the cessation of relevant practices may result in a material imbalance of interests between the parties, or goes against public interests, or is practically unenforceable, the court may, on the basis of balancing the interests involved, resolve the disputes by ordering alternative measures such as more effective compensation or economic reparation, instead of cessation of infringement. Where the claimant who has long been conniving at the infringement upon its right and has failed to take any measures to safeguard its right applies for cessation of such infringement, the court may consider refraining from ordering cessation if such cessation may cause material imbalance of interest between the parties, which, however, shall not hinder the court from granting reasonable compensation in accordance with law.</p> 
				<p>(16) Enhance the remedy, punishment and deterrent effect of infringement compensation so as to lower the cost of safeguarding rights and raising the cost of infringement. In determining infringement compensation, the court shall properly and correctly apply the evidence principle by reviewing the evidence used in the calculation of compensation in a comprehensive and subjective manner, conducting integrated examination and judgment of the authenticity, legality and competence of relevance evidence on the basis of logical reasoning and common sense knowledge, and determining the factual matters of infringement compensation according to the doctrine of "preponderance of the evidence". The court shall actively guide the parties in choosing the method based either on the damages caused by the infringement or profits generated by such infringement, to calculate the amount of infringement compensation and refrain from applying the prescribed compensation mode in a simplistic manner. Where the exact amount of the damage caused by the infringement or profits generated by such infringement is difficult to prove, but there is competent evidence that the aforementioned amount is apparently higher than the maximum compensation amount as provided by law, the court shall, on the basis of a comprehensive consideration of all evidence in the case, determine a compensation amount in excess of the said maximum amount. Unless otherwise provided by law, where the compensation prescribed by law is applied, reasonable costs of safeguarding right shall be calculated and paid separately. Where the court applies the compensation prescribed by law, the court shall provide detailed and accurate explanation of all discretionary factors, so that the finalized compensation shall be reasonable and credible. In determining the amount of the profits generated by infringement on the basis of the claims of the claimant and the fact that the defendant refuses to provide evidences in its possession without any valid reasons, the court shall have sound base or ground, and the amount so determined shall be reasonable and fully persuasive. The court shall pay attention to the validity of calculating compensation on the basis of normal licensing fee by taking into consideration the differences between regular licensing and infringement in terms of implementation, time and scale, etc. The principle that infringement compensation shall be reasonably higher than regular licensing fee shall be followed. The role of auditing and accounting professionals as assistants in determining infringement compensation shall be given full play, so as to guide the parties in employing the help of such professionals in calculating, explaining and cross-examination. Active efforts shall be made to explore the professional assessment of compensation for infringement on intellectual property rights and a professional infringement compensation evaluation mechanism operated by professional institutions shall be introduced when relevant conditions are met.</p> 
				<p>(17) Attention shall be paid to new questions arising in the intellectual property rights in the field of economy and active efforts shall be made to promote the establishment of bases for boosting trade by science and technology and bases for service outsourcing.</p>
				<p>Investigation and research of the protection of intellectual property rights involved in the establishment of bases for boosting trade by science and technology and bases for service outsourcing shall be stepped up and targeted judicial protection for relevant intellectual property rights shall be enhanced, so as to provide a sound judicial environment for the drive to promote the establishment of bases for boosting trade by science and technology and bases for service outsourcing. Protection for intellectual property rights involved in high-tech areas such as information, software, medicine, new materials, aerospace and fine chemicals, etc. shall be enhanced so as to promote the establishment of bases for boosting trade by science and technology. High-tech enterprises shall be guided to enhance their capacity of independent innovation and to create self-owned intellectual property rights; substantial efforts shall also be made to promote the export of new and high technologies with self-owned brand name and intellectual property rights and to enhance the international competitiveness of export products of China. Intellectual property right issues in service outsourcing shall be thoroughly studied so as to promote the construction of bases of service outsourcing. Through judicial trial, efforts shall be made to guide service outsourcing enterprises to enhance their sense of intellectual property rights protection, establish and improve their intellectual property rights protection systems and enhance their competitiveness in service outsourcing.</p> 
				<p>(18) Judicial policies concerning processing trade shall be improved so as to promote the healthy development of the processing trade. Issues concerning the protection of intellectual property rights in processing trade shall be carefully studied, experience in the trial of intellectual property right cases involving the processing trade shall be summarized, prominent problems discovered therein shall be resolved, so as to improve relevant judicial protection policy and promote the transformation and upgrading of the processing trade. Disputes over infringement on trademark which frequently occur in OME processing in foreign trade shall be properly handled. Where such a dispute constitutes infringement on trademark, the court shall properly determine the liabilities for infringement in light of the fact whether the processing party has fulfilled the obligations of necessary examination.</p> 
				<p>(19) Staunchly follow the principle of equal protection for all and refrain from any form of protectionism. The courts at all levels shall hear cases in strict accordance with law and equally protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties, regardless of whether such parties are based in the locality where the courts are located or otherwise, or whether the parties are based in China or otherwise. The courts at all levels shall resolutely contain local protectionism and departmental protectionism, so as to promote a unified and open domestic market, improve investment environment, enhance investor confidence, boost the sound international reputation and image of China and improve the opening up of China's market to the outside world. The courts shall properly handle the relationship between the two overall concerns, namely, the domestic overall concern and the international one, by properly handling major trade-related intellectual property right disputes, actively serving the coordination of the domestic market and the overseas market and the utilization of both domestic resources and overseas resources, so that relevant international conventions and practices will be honored and international trade and economic cooperation be promoted on the one hand, and the national interests and economic security of China will be safeguarded, independent innovation of China will be promoted and the overall competence and international competitiveness of China in terms of intellectual property rights will be enhanced. The courts shall also properly handle the relationship between external relations and the hearing of specific cases, regardless of whether such cases are ordinary foreign-related cases or sensitive cases that may cause international concern, in strict accordance with law and shall refrain from blindly catering to external public opinions at the expense of justice.</p>
				<p>(20) Coordination and direction of cases of the same category and related cases shall be enhanced so as to regulate judicial practices and safeguard the uniformity of the judicial system. The investigation and research as well as professional guidance for cases of the same category shall be improved, the judicial interpretation efforts shall be stepped up, relevant judicial policies shall be improved; the typical-case-based guidance system shall be promoted and the standards for the application of laws shall be clarified and improved. The restraint and regulatory mechanism for the exercise by the judges of the right of discretion shall be strengthened and the standards for the proper exercise of the right of discretion shall be refined. The instance-based supervision over cases concerning the same legal matters but having different judicial verdicts shall be enhanced and the corrective role of second instance and retrial shall be given full play. Coordination and direction of related cases and the coordination mechanism shall be improved. Where related cases involving the same legal facts or the same legal relationships need to be transferred, such cases shall be transferred to competent courts and to be consolidated and heard in accordance with law. The system for the communications between different hearing courts of related courts and the system for applying for the coordination and direction by the common superior court of such courts shall be improved. Courts of later hearing shall voluntarily enhance communications with relevant courts and timely request superior court to coordinate so as to avoid contradictory judgments for such related cases.</p>

				<p>Since the implementation of the Decision of The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to Amend the <strong>Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China</strong> on December 1, 2001, the people's courts have started accepting and trying administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation wherein interested parties sue the Trademark Evaluation Committee of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce for specific administrative acts made by the latter, such as re-assessment of trademarks after rejection, re-assessment of trademarks with disagreements, trademark disputes, and re-assessment of trademark deregistration. The people's courts have made an active exploration with regard to the applicability of the relevant laws and have accumulated rich trial experience. To better try administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation and to further summarize trial experience and clarify and bring into uniformity the criteria for the trial of such cases, the Supreme Court has organized many ad hoc conferences, carried out special-purpose surveys, drawing all-inclusive opinions from relevant courts, agencies, as well as scholars and experts. The Supreme Court has studied and summarized issues relating to the applicability of laws to the trial of administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation. Based on the abovementioned efforts, the Supreme Court sets forth the following opinions with regard to the trial of cases of this type by taking into account the actual trial practice, pursuant to the provisions of the <strong>Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China and Administrative Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China</strong>.</p>
				<p><em>1.</em>With regard to trademarks under dispute that have not been widely used, a people's court, while trying administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation, can impose strict trademark authorization confirmation criteria in accordance with the law in the examination and judgment of authorization confirmation conditions, such as trademark similarity and goods similarity, and in the handling of conflicts with the earlier trademark. The people's court shall take into full consideration the interests of consumers and peer business operators, effectively suppress misconduct of preemptive registration, focus on protecting the interests of business marks, such as earlier trademarks and enterprise names with high profile and strong distinctiveness, and try to eliminate the likelihood of confusion between trademarks. With regard to those trademarks under dispute that have been used for a long period of time, have established considerable market visibility, and have attracted the relevant public, the people's court shall accurately understand the legislative spirit of the <strong>Trademark Law</strong> to balance protecting of the interests of earlier business marks and maintaining the market order, fully respect the fact that public consumers have already objectively distinguished the relevant trademarks from one another, and attach importance to protecting the established and stable market order.</p>
				<p><em>2.</em> In actual practice, certain marks or components thereof are exaggerated, but not sufficient to be misleading based on daily life experience or general perception of the relevant public. For such circumstances, a people's court is advised not to deem those marks as marks with exaggerated publicity and deceiving intentions.</p>
				<p><em>3.</em> A people's court, while examining and ruling whether the marks in question result in other adverse impacts, shall consider whether such marks or other components thereof are likely to cause negative and adverse impacts to the public interests and public order of the country, in terms of politics, economy, culture, religion, ethnics, etc. If the registration of the marks in question is only detrimental to particular civil rights, it is advised not to deem the case to have other adverse impacts since the <strong>Trademark Law</strong> provides a remedy method and corresponding procedures.</p>
				<p><em>4.</em> The <strong>Trademark Law</strong> provides that the name of an administrative jurisdiction above the county level and foreign place names widely known may not be registered or used as trademarks. In practice, where some trademarks consist of place names and other elements, if a trademark includes other elements, demonstrates distinctiveness as a whole, does not carry the meaning of the place name or have it as its primary meaning, it is advised not to determine that the trademark may not be registered due to its inclusion of names of administrative jurisdictions above the county level and foreign place names widely known.</p>
				<p><em>5.</em> A people's court, while trying administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation, shall examine and judge from an overall perspective whether a trademark has distinctiveness based on common perception of the relevant public with regard to goods designated to use the trademark under dispute. If the descriptive elements in the mark do not affect its overall distinctiveness, or the descriptive mark is expressed in a unique way by which the relevant public can identify the origin of the goods, it shall be concluded that the trademark possess distinctiveness.</p>
				<p><em>6.</em> A people's court, while trying administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation, shall examine and judge whether foreign language trademarks have distinctiveness based on the general perception of the relevant public within the territory of China. Foreign words in trademarks under dispute have inherent meanings; however the relevant public can identify the origin of goods by the trademarks. This does not prejudice the determination of its distinctiveness.</p>
				<p><em>7.</em> A people's court, while determining whether the trademark under dispute is a generic name, shall examine whether it is a statutory or conventional goods name. Those trademarks that are generic names according to the law, national standards, or industrial standards shall be deemed to be generic names. If a name can signify goods of a category according to the relevant public, such a name shall be deemed as a generic name. Goods names listed in professional reference books and dictionaries can be used as reference to determine conventional generic names.<br/>Conventional generic names are usually determined according to the general perception of the relevant public nationwide. Generic names of regular goods in the relevant markets as a result of historical tradition, local customs, and geographic environments can be deemed as generic names.<br/>If an applicant is or should be aware of the trademark he applies for registration being a conventional goods name in certain regions, the trademark to be registered shall be deemed as a generic name.</p>
				<p><em>8.</em> A people's court, while determining whether the trademark under dispute is a generic name, usually shall base its ruling on the reality at the time when the trademark registration application is filed. If a trademark was not a generic name when the application was filed but has become one by the time the registration thereof is being processed, the trademark shall still be deemed as a generic name of goods. If a trademark was the generic name of goods when the application was filed but is no longer one by the time the registration thereof is being processed, the registration thereof shall not be prejudiced.</p> 
				<p><em>9.</em> If a mark merely or primarily describes and explains the features, such as quality, major raw materials, function, application, weight, quantity, place of manufacturing, it shall be deemed to possess no distinctiveness. Where a mark or the elements thereof connote the features of the goods but does not affect the function of identifying the origin of the goods, it shall not be deemed to fall into the circumstance prescribed in the preceding sentence.</p>
				<p><em>10.</em> A people's court, while trying administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation involving the protection of well-known trademarks, can refer to the relevant provisions of Article 5, Article 9, and Article 10 of the Interpretation of the Supreme People's Court concerning Certain Issues relating to the Application of Laws in the Trial of Cases of Civil Disputes Arising from the Protection of Well-known Trademarks.</p>
				<p><em>11.</em> With regard to well-known trademarks registered in China, when the protection scope relating to dissimilar goods is determined, the scope shall be made commensurate with their repute. With regard to trademarks registered in China that are widely known by the public, a wide protection scope commensurate with their repute shall be ruled when the protection scope relating to dissimilar goods is determined.</p>
				<p><em>12.</em> Where a trademark agent, representative, or agent/representative based on sales agency relationship, without authorization, registers the trademark of its principal in his own name, a people's court shall deem it an act wherein the agent/representative files preemptive registration of the trademark of the principal. In trial practice, some preemptive registration acts occur while the agent/representative relationship is still under negotiation, i.e. preemptive registration happens before the agent/representative relationship is established. Such a case shall be deemed as a preemptive registration act of the agent/representative. A trademark registration applicant who files preemptive registration of a trademark through collusion with the above agent or representative can be deemed as an agent or representative. Collusion acts of preemptive registration can be inferred based on the particular relationships between the trademark registration applicant and the aforementioned agent or representative in light of the reality.</p>
				<p><em>13.</em> Trademarks for which an agent or representative may not apply registration include both marks identical with that of the principal and similar marks. Goods for which an agent or representative may not apply registration include both goods identical with the principal's goods that use the trademark and similar goods.</p>
				<p><em>14.</em> A people's court, while trying administrative cases of trademark authorization confirmation to determine goods similarity and resemblance, can refer to the relevant provisions of the Interpretation of the Supreme People's Court concerning Certain Issues relating to the Application of Laws in the Trial of Cases of Civil Disputes Arising from the Protection of Trade Marks.</p>
				<p><em>15.</em> A people's court, while examining and determining the similarity of the relevant goods or services, shall consider whether, among other things, the function, application, manufacturing units, sales channels, consumer groups are identical or highly connected, whether the purpose, content, method, recipients of the services are identical or highly connected, whether the goods and services are highly connected, whether it tends to make the relevant public believe that the goods and services are provided by the same entity, or whether the providers are related in a particular way. International Classification of Goods and Services for Trademark Registration and Distinction between Similar Goods and Services can be used as references to determine the similarity between goods or services.</p>
				<p><em>16.</em> A people's court, while determining the similarity of trademarks, shall not only consider the similarity of trademark components as well as their similarity as a whole but also the distinctiveness and repute of the trademarks in question, as well as the connection between the trademarks. Whether it tends to result in confusion is to be used as the criterion for judgment.</p>
				<p><em>17.</em> The summarizing provision concerning "Application for trademark registration shall not be detrimental to the existing earlier rights of others" in Article 31 is to be correctly understood and applied. A people's court, while examining and determining whether a trademark under dispute is detrimental to the existing earlier rights of others, shall protect the earlier rights which are specifically provided by the <strong>Trademark Law</strong> pursuant to the specific provisions of the <strong>Trademark Law</strong>. Where the <strong>Trademark Law</strong> is silent, the legitimate rights to be protected pursuant to the General Civil Law (of the People's Republic of China) and other laws and regulations shall be protected pursuant to the summarizing provision.<br/>A people's court, while examining and determining whether a trademark under dispute is detrimental to the earlier rights of others, usually bases its ruling on the date when the application for the trademark under dispute is filed. If the earlier right does not exist when the trademark under dispute is being processed for registration, the registration thereof shall not be prejudiced.</p>
				<p><em>18.</em> According to the <strong>Trademark Law</strong>, an applicant shall not, via improper means, file preemptive registration for a trademark of others that has been in use and has certain market visibility. If an applicant files preemptive registration for a trademark of others that has been in use and has certain market visibility while being or should be aware of it, the applicant shall be deemed to have taken improper means.<br/>Trademarks practically used within the territory of China and known by the relevant public within a certain region shall be deemed as trademarks that have been in use and have certain market visibility. Where evidence proves that an earlier trademark has been in use for a certain time period, in a region, or has been advertised to a certain extent, the trademark can be deemed to have market visibility.
				With regard to trademarks that have been in use and have certain market visibility, it is advised not to protect them in relation to dissimilar goods.</p>
				<p><em>19.</em> A people's court, while trying administrative cases involving the revocation of registered trademarks, and examining and ruling whether a trademark under dispute has been registered via improper means, shall consider whether it is a means to achieve improper gains other than fraud such as disruption of trademark registration order, harming the public interest, and misappropriation of public resources. Cases that are only detrimental to particular civil rights shall be examined and ruled pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 41 and other relevant provisions.</p>
				<p><em>20.</em> A people's court, while trying administrative cases involving the revocation of trademarks that have not been used for three consecutive years, shall correctly determine whether the acts in question constitute actual use according to the legislative spirit of the relevant <strong>Trademark Law</strong> provisions.<br/>A trademark proprietor's use of its own, use by others with his consent, and other uses that do not violate the intention of the proprietor can all be deemed as actual use acts. Despite the nuanced difference between a trademark in actual use and an officially registered trademark, if the distinctiveness thereof is not altered, it can be deemed as use of a registered trademark. With regard to uses of a trademark that has not been in actual use, and only has transfer or permissive acts, or only has announcements of the registered trademark information or exclusive entitlement thereof, it is advised not to deem them as uses of trademark.<br/>If a trademark proprietor fails to actually use or discontinue to use a registered trademark due to objective reasons, such as force majeure, policy restriction, and bankruptcy liquidation, or a trademark proprietor has actual intention to use the trademark and has necessary preparation for actual use but has not actually used the registered trademark due to other objective reasons, the cases can all be deemed to have justifiable reasons.</p>

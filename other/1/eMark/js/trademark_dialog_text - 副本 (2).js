That is to say, the official fees by either single-class system or multi-class system are equal on the basis of same items of goods/services."+
					"<p>2. The official fee for a same class of 10 items of goods/services is RMB ￥800.00 yuan as basic fee, for each additional item in excess of ten under the same class RMB ￥80.00 yuan."+
					"<p>For example, for an application that contains 15 items of goods/service under a same class, the official fee is RMB ￥1200.00 yuan."+
					"<p>3. If the number of items under a same class is less than 10, the official fee is still RMB ￥800.00 yuan, rather than calculated by number of items."+
					"<p>For example, for an application that contains 5 items of goods/services, the official fee is RMB ￥800.00 yuan.</p>"+
					"<p>For a multi-class application that contains 15 items of goods/service wherein 12 items in class A and 3 items in class B, the official fee totals RMB ￥1760.00 yuan (RMB ￥960.00 yuan for class A + RMB ￥800.00 yuan for class B).

					"<p style='text-align:center;font-weight:bold;'>I. What is single-class application? And What is multi-class application?</p>"+
					"<p>China has been practicing single-class system of application before implementing the 3rd Amendment of the Trademark Law since May 1, 2014 (“the new law”). That is to say, an application may apply for registration of a mark on a single class of goods/services in one application.</p>"+
					"<p>The other system is the multi-class application. It is mainly reflected in Article 22 of the new law, providing that “an applicant may apply for registration of a same trademark on multiple classes of goods/services in a same application.” That is to say, an application form may contain applications on multiple classes of goods/services, or a certificate of trademark registration (a registration number) may contain registrations on multiple classes of goods/services.</p>"+
					"<p style='text-align:center;font-weight:bold;'>II. Corresponding Division under the Two Application Systems</p>"+
					"<p>There is no division clause under the single-class system in the old law regarding the partial refusal during prosecution. Thus partial refusal will render the whole mark into the procedure review just as the overall refusal does. That is to say, if an applicant wishes to maintain a mark that is partially rejected, later in the procedure of review it has to waiver those that has already been approved during the preliminary examination.</p>"+
					"<p>The new law sets up the multi-class system of application and provides the corresponding division clauses. Rule 22 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trademark Law of China provides that “where China Trademark Office rejects an application on certain designated good/services, the applicant may divide the preliminarily approved portion of the said application into another application. The date of application of the original application shall be retained for the divisional application.</p>"+
					"<p>Where an application needs to be divided, the applicant shall apply to divide the said application with China Trademark Office within 15 days upon receipt of the Notification of Partial Refusal issued by China Trademark Office.</p>"+
					"<p>Upon receipt of the application for dividing the original application, China Trademark Office shall divide the original application into two separate applications, generate a new application number for the portion that is preliminary approved as a result of the division, and publish the same.”</p>"+
					"<p>According to the new law, a multi-class application/registration may not be divided except in the event of partial refusal during examination, a multi-class application may be divided into two so as to maintain the preliminarily approved portion first and apply for review regarding to the rejected portion. In other words, an applicant may not divide a multi-class application if someone files an opposition only against part of the goods/services or an applicant/registrant tries to assign part of the goods/services.</p>"+
					"<p>As stressed in the third “Notes” of the Instruction on the Division of Application of Trademark Registration and the Announcement on the Issues for Attention published by China Trademark Office on August 20, 2014, “each application may be divided for once only, which only applies to the procedure of refusal of part of the goods/services of an application, and does not apply to any other procedures.”</p>"+
					"<p style='text-align:center;font-weight:bold;'>III. Pros & Cons of Multi-Class Application</p>"+
					"<p>Multi-class application is relatively simple in terms of the procedure. Such applications will be subject to the prosecution of a same examiner, so as to avoid difference of discretion. Such system is designed to secure the rights and interest of trademark applicants, and streamlines the registration process with efficiency and quality.</p>"+
					"<p>However, the corresponding division under such system is far from satisfactory.</p>"+
					"<p>On one hand, the multi-class application/registration becomes cumbersome in the procedure of assignment or licensing etc compared with that for the sing-class application/registration, because multi-class application/registration may not be divided except in the event of partial refusal.</p>"+
					"<p>On the other hand, if the description of goods in one class is not acceptable, the process of the entire application will be delayed for further examination. Same situation as it is in other countries, but it seems more risky in China as the Chinese Trademark Office may incline to give only one chance to the applicant for amendment of goods/services during the prosecution, and may refuse the application if the applicant fails to amend properly. This brings high risk to the applications in other class(es) in which the description of goods/services is acceptable.</p>"+
					"<p>In addition, there is no difference for the official fees between single-class application and multi-class application.</p>"+
					"<p>Given the above, an applicant has to weigh the pros and cons based on the actual condition of its application/brand. Generally speaking, an applicant with a large portfolio in China may consider the multi-class application to improve efficiency. While if the search result suggests little margin for refusal regarding certain class(es) on which the applicant wishes to get registered, it may file single-class application(s). Multi-class application will become cumbersome and incur more costs if it is rejected and has to be divided in the review.</p>"+

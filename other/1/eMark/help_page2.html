			<p class='help_from_title'>1. Why the two fields “Applicant (in Chinese)” and “Address of Applicant (in Chinese)” are darkened and locked?</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>These two fields involve translation and typewriting of Chinese, which will be handled manually during the processing of application. The attorneys from emarkchina.com shall translate and double check the two fields.</p>
		</li>
		<li class='help_from_list'>
			<p class='help_from_title'>2. What is “Previous Applicants”?</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>“Previous Applicants” is a pull-down list of all the previous applicants from which you may just choose one to retrieve information into an Application Form and save the trouble of typing the same information every time you file application in his/her/its name. The rank will vary as the most frequent ones are always among the top.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>For your further information, you may not just create a new applicant with the same identity but different information (e.g. same business registration number but different name or address). Such application, if submitted, is very likely to be rejected during examination on the basis of similarity to the original applicant’s marks. We strongly recommend you to contact us at info@emarkchina.com if your applicant(s) is/are involve(s) in such changes.</p>
		</li>
		<li class='help_from_list'>
			<p class='help_from_title'>3. Are there any special requirements for the supporting materials?</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>The certificate of identity/incorporation and power of attorney shall be scanned with color into pdf format and shall bear the signature or seal of the applicant.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>The file size of power of attorney shall not exceed 1 M and the certificate of identity/incorporation not exceed 2 M.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>The specimen of your mark shall be in jpg format. The file shall be less than 200KB, and the pixel between 400*400 and 1500*1500. If you prefer to upload a scan copy of specimen, it shall be scanned into a size between 5 cm*5 cm to 10 cm*10 cm in 24-colored, 300dpi-resolutioned parameters.Please ensure that the grey scale of the scanned image matches that of the original trademark specimen, and also leave a blank space not less than 3 mm around the specimen for the purpose of good printing of trademark publication and certificate of registration.</p>
		</li>
		<li class='help_from_list'>
			<p class='help_from_title'>4. What if I don’t know which class(es) of goods/services I should choose?</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>If you don’t know which class(es) of goods/services you should choose, or you are not sure if your application covers all the related class(es), you may refer to our class recommendation function. That is, you shall go to step 2 “Trademark”, choose your industry from the “Industry” list, and the system will recommend a number of classes that are associated with your industry as shown in the “Recommendation” for you to choose from. You may also “View all classes” as well.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>Youmay wonder on what basis those class(es) are recommended. First of all, those classes are determined according to your industry and products in a priority order as follows: main products, trans-class product, associated services, products from the industry chain, services from the industry chain, products/services that are likely to be confused, and products/services that need to protect against derogation.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>Taking smartwatch as an example. It can be both wristwatch and smart device. Therefore, its designated classes may include: class 14 (watch), class 9 (software and peripheral equipment), class 35 (sale and advertisement), class 38 (data transmission), class 42 (software development), and class 37 (repair). Among those, class 14 and 9 cover main products, class 35, 38 and 42 cover main service, class 37 covers an indispensable service in the product chain.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>If you are to decide the classes of your essential products, or you think this recommendation function may not satisfy your need, please contact us at info@emarkchina.com to consult with our attorney in detail..</p>
		</li>
		<li class='help_from_list'>
			<p class='help_from_title'>5. If I were to choose certain goods/services that cover multiple subclasses, e.g. clothing, do I have to choose it only once or choose repeatedly for each subclasses?</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>Same goods/services may appear in multiple subclasses under a same class. Therefore, if an applicant were to choose such items, he/she/it needs to choose such items for once only; if an applicant chooses such items by multiple times, it shall be deemed as to have chosen multiple goods/services and shall incur more official fee based on the number of items.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>For detailed calculation of official fee, please refer to the <a href='javascript:;' class='J_rule'>Fee Rules</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li class='help_from_list'>
			<p class='help_from_title'>6. What is single-class application and multi-class application? What is the difference between them?</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>Please refer to the article <a href='javascript:;' class='J_different'>Single-Class Application vs. Multi-Class Application</a> for details.</p>
		</li>
		<li class='help_from_list'>
			<p class='help_from_title'>7. I could download a power of attorney either when starting an application (on the guide page), or as I went to the page of upload. And I could also “use previous signature” as well. Which one shall I use?</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>We offer a template of Power of Attorney both in the start page of Application and in the upload page. You may click “Power of Attorney” and see the download link. Also, after you have reached the step of “Upload”, you may also download it at hand. Alternatively, we further offer to use previous image of signature on the POA which you have already signed and uploaded, to sign a new POA in the backstage and save steps. Please be advised that we have strict control over those signatures and will not put it in any unauthorized use.</p>
			<p class='help_from_text'>We should remind you that if it takes long to prepare an eligible POA, i.e. have it signed and scanned according the official requirements, we recommend to download it before you start application, because the network may disconnected when you are preparing it.</p>
